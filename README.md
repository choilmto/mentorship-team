# Node.js Mentorship Program

As a student of [Bridge School](https://bridgeschool.io/), I've learned how fun and empowering learning can be. I want to help shape the Node Mentorship program to encourage diversity, with emphasis on growth:
1. personal growth for mentees and mentors
2. fostering understanding of Node.js
3. expanding the user base of Node.js

Seeing people change is incredibly rewarding, and as long as I maintain [a beginner's mind](https://zenhabits.net/beginner/), I'm sure I'll be inspired by the ways in which others learn.
